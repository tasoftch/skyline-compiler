# Skyline CMS Compiler
Skyline CMS boots from a compiled file structure.  
The compilation allows it to increase performance while delivering your website, but also, detect possible bug before they occur.

When you are creating a project using composer, you do not need to require the compiler.  
in fact, creating projects in development, includes the compiler package automatically.

### Direct install
````bin
$ composer require skyline/compiler
````
You can setup several configuration to automatically compile within your IDE, but Skyline CMS will not compile automatically.
